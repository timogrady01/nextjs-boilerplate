# Vercel Deployment Process for Express Vehicle Locators

After updating your GitHub repository with the new Next.js compatible files, follow these steps to deploy your Express Vehicle Locators website on Vercel:

## 1. Automatic Deployment

If your GitHub repository is already connected to Vercel (as shown in your screenshot), the deployment should happen automatically when you push changes to your repository. Here's what happens:

1. You push changes to your GitHub repository
2. Vercel detects the changes and triggers a new deployment
3. Vercel builds your Next.js application
4. Once the build is successful, Vercel deploys the new version of your website

## 2. Verify Deployment Status

To check the status of your deployment:

1. Log in to your Vercel account: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select the "express-vehicle-locators" project
3. Go to the "Deployments" tab
4. Look for the latest deployment and check its status

## 3. View Your Deployed Website

Once the deployment is complete, you can access your website at the following URLs (based on your screenshot):

- Main domain: nextjs-boilerplate-tau-ashy-53.vercel.app
- Production branch: nextjs-boilerplate-git-main-express-vehicle-locators.vercel.app

## 4. Custom Domain Setup (Optional)

If you want to use a custom domain for your website:

1. Go to your project settings in Vercel
2. Click on "Domains"
3. Add your custom domain
4. Follow Vercel's instructions to configure DNS settings with your domain registrar

## 5. Environment Variables (If Needed)

If your application requires environment variables:

1. Go to your project settings in Vercel
2. Click on "Environment Variables"
3. Add any required environment variables
4. Redeploy your application if necessary

## 6. Troubleshooting Deployment Issues

If you encounter any issues with your deployment:

1. Check the build logs in Vercel for error messages
2. Verify that your Next.js application builds successfully locally
3. Make sure all dependencies are properly listed in package.json
4. Check that your Next.js configuration is correct

## 7. Rollback to Previous Version (If Needed)

If you need to revert to a previous version:

1. Go to the "Deployments" tab in Vercel
2. Find the previous working deployment
3. Click on the three dots menu and select "Promote to Production"

## 8. Monitoring Your Website

Vercel provides analytics and monitoring tools:

1. Go to the "Analytics" tab to view visitor statistics
2. Check the "Logs" section for runtime errors
3. Set up "Monitoring" for performance tracking

## 9. Updating Your Website

For future updates:

1. Make changes to your local repository
2. Test locally using `npm run dev`
3. Commit and push changes to GitHub
4. Vercel will automatically deploy the updates
